# Three Tier SAP JAVA on HANA DB Deployment

## Description
This automation solution is designed for the deployment of **Three Tier SAP JAVA on HANA DB** using IBM Cloud Schematics or CLI. The SAP solution will be deployed on top of one of the following Operating Systems: **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 3 for SAP**, **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP**, **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 for SAP** in an existing IBM Cloud Gen2 VPC, using an existing bastion host with secure remote SSH access.

## Installation media
SAP HANA installation media used for this deployment is the default one for **SAP HANA, platform edition 2.0 SPS05** available at SAP Support Portal under *INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE* area and it has to be provided manually in the input parameter file.

SAP JAVA installation media used for this deployment is the default one for **SAP Netweaver 7.5** available at SAP Support Portal under *INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE* area and it has to be provided manually in the input parameter file.

## VSI Configuration
The VSIs are deployed with one of the following Operating Systems for DB server: Suse Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 3 for SAP HANA (amd64), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP HANA (amd64) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 for SAP HANA (amd64) and with one of the following Operating Systems for APP server: Suse Enterprise Linux 1 SP3 for SAP Applications (amd64), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP Applications (amd64), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 for SAP Applications (amd64). The SSH keys are configured to allow root user access. The following storage volumes are creating during the provisioning:

HANA DB VSI Disks:
- 3 x 500 GB disks with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA

SAP JAVA APP VSI Disks:
- 1 x 40 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - SWAP
- 1 x 128 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA

In order to perform the deployment you can use either the CLI component or the GUI component (Schematics) of the automation solution.

## 1.1 Executing the deployment of **Three Tier SAP BW/4HANA Stack** in GUI (Schematics)

The solution is based on Terraform remote-exec and Ansible playbooks executed by Schematics and it is implementing a 'reasonable' set of best practices for SAP VSI host configuration.

**It contains:**
  -  Terraform scripts for the deployment of two VSIs, in an EXISTING VPC, with Subnet and Security Group. The VSIs are intended to be used: one for the data base instance and the other for the application instance.
  -  Bash scripts used for the checking of the prerequisites required by SAP VSIs deployment and for the integration into a single step in IBM Schematics GUI of the VSI provisioning and the **Three Tier SAP BW/4HANA Stack** installation.
  -  Ansible scripts to configure Three Tier SAP JAVA primary application server and a HANA 2.0 node. Please note that Ansible is started by Terraform and must be available on the same host.

## IBM Cloud API Key
For the script configuration add your IBM Cloud API Key in terraform planning phase command 'terraform plan --out plan1'.
You can create an API Key [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).

## Input parameter file
The solution is configured by editing your variables in the file `input.auto.tfvars`
Edit your VPC, Subnet, Security group, Hostname, Profile, Image, SSH Keys like so:

## VPC Configuration
The Security Rules are the following:
- Allow all traffic in the Security group
- Allow all outbound traffic
- Allow inbound DNS traffic (UDP port 53)
- Allow inbound SSH traffic (TCP port 22)

## Files description and structure:
 - `modules` - directory containing the terraform modules
 - `input.auto.tfvars` - contains the variables that will need to be edited by the user to customize the solution
 - `main.tf` - contains the configuration of the VSI for SAP single tier deployment.
 - `output.tf` - contains the code for the information to be displayed after the VSI is created (Hostname, Private IP, Public IP)
 - `provider.tf` - contains the IBM Cloud Provider data in order to run `terraform init` command.
 - `variables.tf` - contains variables for the VPC and VSI
 - `versions.tf` - contains the minimum required versions for terraform and IBM Cloud provider.

## Steps to follow:

For initializing terraform:

```shell
terraform init
```

For planning phase:

```shell
terraform plan --out plan1
# you will be asked for the following sensitive variables: 'ibmcloud_api_key' and 'sap_main_password'.
```

For apply phase:

```shell
terraform apply "plan1"
```

For destroy:

```shell
terraform destroy
# you will be asked for the following sensitive variables as a destroy confirmation phase: 'ibmcloud_api_key' and 'sap_main_password'.
```

## 1.2 Executing the deployment of **Three Tier SAP S/4HANA Stack** in CLI

The solution is based on Terraform scripts and Ansible playbooks executed in CLI and it is implementing a 'reasonable' set of best practices for SAP VSI host configuration.

**It contains:**
  -  Terraform scripts for the deployment of two VSIs, in an EXISTING VPC, with Subnet and Security Group. The VSIs are intended to be used: one for the data base instance and the other for the application instance.
  -  Ansible scripts to configure Three Tier SAP JAVA primary application server and a HANA 2.0 node. Please note that Ansible is started by Terraform and must be available on the same host.

## IBM Cloud API Key
For the script configuration add your IBM Cloud API Key in terraform planning phase command 'terraform plan --out plan1'.
You can create an API Key [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).

**Obs***: <br />
- Sensitive - The variable value is not displayed in your tf files details after terrafrorm plan&apply commands.<br />
- The following variables should be the same like the bastion ones: REGION, ZONE, VPC, SUBNET, SECURITY_GROUP.

**SAP Main Password**
The password for the SAP system will be asked interactively during terraform plan step and will not be available after the deployment.

Parameter | Description | Requirements
----------|-------------|-------------
sap_main_password | Common password for all users that are created during the installation | <ul><li>It must be 8 to 14 characters long</li><li>It must contain at least one digit (0-9)</li><li>It must not contain \ (backslash) and " (double quote)</li></ul>

## VPC Configuration
The Security Rules are the following:
- Allow all traffic in the Security group
- Allow all outbound traffic
- Allow inbound DNS traffic (UDP port 53)
- Allow inbound SSH traffic (TCP port 22)

## Files description and structure:
 - `modules` - directory containing the terraform modules
 - `input.auto.tfvars` - contains the variables that will need to be edited by the user to customize the solution
 - `main.tf` - contains the configuration of the VSI for SAP single tier deployment.
 - `output.tf` - contains the code for the information to be displayed after the VSI is created (Hostname, Private IP, Public IP)
 - `provider.tf` - contains the IBM Cloud Provider data in order to run `terraform init` command.
 - `variables.tf` - contains variables for the VPC and VSI
 - `versions.tf` - contains the minimum required versions for terraform and IBM Cloud provider.

## Steps to follow:

For initializing terraform:

```shell
terraform init
```

For planning phase:

```shell
terraform plan --out plan1
# you will be asked for the following sensitive variables: 'ibmcloud_api_key' and 'sap_main_password'.
```

For apply phase:

```shell
terraform apply "plan1"
```

For destroy:

```shell
terraform destroy
# you will be asked for the following sensitive variables as a destroy confirmation phase: 'ibmcloud_api_key' and 'sap_main_password'.
```
